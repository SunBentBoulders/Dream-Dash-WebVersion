	<h1>So what is Dream Dash about?</h1>
	<h4>	
		<p>Dream Dash is a continuous runner game set in the mind of an adventurous young kid. As our character drifts off into a deep sleep, their imagination begins to take over. They are trapped in a dream, and the only way to wake themselves up is the sound of an alarm clock! "So what's the catch?" you may ask... <img src="./img/friendlyGhost.png" align="right" width="150px">Ghoolies are everywhere, and they want to steal your light in order to trap you in the dark. As you dash across the screen swooping through the baddies, and collecting the alarm clocks, don't forget to replenish your supply of candles if it gets low. Remember, without the light, you are trapped in the abyss of night-time imaginations.</p>

		<p>This project is bigger than any of the engineers that contributed to its design. Dream Dash was created with the youthful ignorance and indifference to gender and race we all once had. (insert picture of team) We wanted our users to be able to download our game,and feel included, no matter who you are, or what you look like. We stand behind inclusion and diversity in the tech industry, and pride ourselves on showing that in our work.</p>

	<h1>Tech Stack</h1>
	<h4>
		<p>Dream Dash was created using Phaser.js, an open-sourced HTML5 game engine and development framework built on top of the Javascript object-oriented programming language(insert phaser pic). The best part of using this technology was the ability to use Canvas+ when designing the physics, as it allowed for 60 frames per second enabling a smoother user experience than WebGL or WebView. As we created Dream Dash, we thought it would be great if it was accessible on mobile platforms as well. Enter CocoonJS...
		<p>CocoonJS is a compiling tool, built on top of Cordova, that translates javascript into native Swift code(iOS) and Java(Android). This was perfect for deploying Dream Dash on both iOS and Android application stores.</p>
		<p>Some other tech used in the process includes AngularJS, XCode, AndroidSDK, and Jasmine Testing Suite.</p>
