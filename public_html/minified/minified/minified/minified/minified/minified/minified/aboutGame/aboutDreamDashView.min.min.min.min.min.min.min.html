Trapped in a dream, the only way to wake up is to sound the alarm while swooping and dodging the ghoulies that want to steal your light and trap you in the dark. As you dash across the screen collecting the alarm clocks, don't forget to replenish your supply of candles to guide your way through.</p><hr class="featurette-divider"><div class="row featurette info-header" align="center"><div class="col-md-7"><h2 class="featurette-heading">Sun Bent Boulder Pride</h2></div></div><hr class="featurette-divider"><p>Bigger than anything we could have hoped for, <em>Dream Dash</em> was created with inclusivity at heart. All characters are designed to be as close to gender and racially neutral as possible for the game to be ultimately accessible and enjoyed by all.<!-- (insert picture of team, centered or right-aligned) --> No matter who you are or what you look like, we stand behind our principles and want every person to feel included. So come and roll with us and enjoy some of that boulder pride.</p><hr class="featurette-divider"><div class="row featurette info-header" align="center"><div class="col-md-7"><h2 class="featurette-heading">Tech Stack</h2></div></div><hr class="featurette-divider"><img src="./assets/images/phaser_cocoonCopy.png" width="500px" align="center"><p><em>Dream Dash</em> was created using Phaser.js, an open-sourced HTML5 game engine and development framework built on top of the Javascript object-oriented programming language. We used Canvas+ when designing the physics, as it allowed for framerates up to 60 frames per second, enabling a smoother user experience.</p><p>To adapt the game for mobile platforms, we used CocoonJS, a compiling tool built on top of Cordova. CocoonJS translates Javascript into native Java(Android) and Swift code(iOS), proving perfect for deploying the game to both Android and iOS app stores and allow us ample time to still be home in time for cornflakes.</p><p>Other tech implemented along the way included use of :<ul><li>AngularJS</li><li>XCode</li><li>AndroidSDK</li><li>Gulp</li><li>Jasmine Testing Suite</li></ul></p></div>
